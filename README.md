# PortfolioRL
## Optimizing Portfolio Diversification using Reinforcement Learning
### Team: Isaac Efrosman, Sam Park

PortfolioRLâ€™s goal is to use reinforcement learning techniques to optimize portfolio diversification allowing users to
make more informed financial decisions. PortfolioRL aims to do this by providing AI, data-driven
strategies that adapt to changing market conditions. We plan to achieve this by using PyTorch
and existing financial datasets to create a robust RL model.

In addition to the core model, PortfolioRL would like to also develop an interactive web
application (React, FastAPI, PostgreSQL) that allows users to visualize model outputs and
experiment with various financial scenarios.
